# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation of a Mall

This project uses **unsupervised learning** to segment mall customers based on their spending behavior and demographics. By applying **KMeans Clustering**, **PCA**, and **Silhouette Score**, we identify distinct customer groups to support targeted marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Objective

To group customers into meaningful segments using:
- 🧑 Age
- 💸 Annual Income
- 🛒 Spending Score

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- **Standard Scaling** for feature normalization
- **KMeans Clustering** to identify customer segments
- **Silhouette Score** to evaluate clustering performance
- **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and visualization

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 Key Insights

- Optimal number of clusters determined using Silhouette Score.
- PCA helped visualize customer segments in 2D space.
- Clear segmentation enables personalized marketing strategies.
